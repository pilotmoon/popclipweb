PopClip is available as a one-time purchase by buying a license key.

::: info üìù Message from the developer

_Hi, this is Nick, the developer of PopClip. I have been maintaining PopClip for
13 years already and am committed to keeping it updated and improving it for
many years to come. I hope you will consider supporting my work by buying a
license. Thank you._

<!-- ::: info <AppstoreIcon style="fill: var(--vp-c-text-1); display: inline-block; height:16px; vertical-align: middle; margin:  0 -4px 0 -3px;" />&nbsp;PopClip has left the Mac App Store

As of 20th March 2024, PopClip is no longer distributed on the Mac App Store. I explained the reasons in a [forum post](https://forum.popclip.app/t/popclip-is-leaving-the-mac-app-store/2188).

Existing Mac App Store customers may [migrate for free to the Standalone edition](https://www.popclip.app/kb/mas) to continue receiving updates.

## Setapp

Alternatively, PopClip is also available as part of a
[Setapp subscription](https://go.setapp.com/stp304?refAppId=159&refVendorId=92).
This is a great option if you are interested in using the other apps available
from Setapp as well.

## Volume Purchase

If you are buying for a team or organization you can purchase a multi-user
license key at a discounted rate. Please [email me](/support) for a quote.

## Terms and Conditions

Your purchase is subject to the [Terms of License](/terms).

## Student Discount

Students can get a discount on a personal license key via
[Student App Centre](https://studentappcentre.com/app/popclip).

## Free

PopClip has a free trial mode which is fully functional. So if you just want to
try out PopClip, you can [download it](/download) and use every feature for
free.

After you have used 250 actions in the app it will start to nag you periodically
to buy a license key.

After you have used up the free trial, I hope you will consider either buying a license or subscribing via Setapp, both of which directly support my work on the app.

However, I understand that not everyone is in the financial position to do so. I never want money to be the reason that someone cannot use PopClip, so if you have already used up the free trial and you cannot afford to buy right now, email me, and I will send you a 1-year license for free.
