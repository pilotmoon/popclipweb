# Buy PopClip

## One-time Purchase

PopClip is available as a one-time purchase by buying a license key.

<Buy />

::: info <AppstoreIcon style="fill: var(--vp-c-text-1); display: inline-block; height:16px; vertical-align: middle; margin:  0 -4px 0 -3px;" />&nbsp;PopClip has left the Mac App Store

As of 20th March 2024, PopClip is no longer distributed on the Mac App Store. I explained the reasons in a [forum post](https://forum.popclip.app/t/popclip-is-leaving-the-mac-app-store/2188).

Existing Mac App Store customers may [migrate for free to the Standalone edition](https://www.popclip.app/kb/mas) to continue receiving updates.

## Setapp

Alternatively, PopClip is also available as part of a
[Setapp subscription](https://go.setapp.com/stp304?refAppId=159&refVendorId=92).

This is a great option if you are interested in using the other apps available from
Setapp as well.

## Terms and Conditions

Your purchase is subject to the [Terms of License](/terms).

## Student Discount

Students can get a discount on a PopClip license key via
[Student App Centre](https://studentappcentre.com/app/popclip).

## Free

PopClip has a free trial mode which is fully functional. So if you just want to
try out PopClip, you can [download it](/download) and use every feature for
free.

After you have used 150 actions inside the app (and that usually takes a few
weeks of use), the app will start to nag you periodically to buy a license key.

If you have already used the free trial and you cannot afford PopClip,
[email me](/support), and I will send you a 1-year license for free.
