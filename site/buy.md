<!-- ::: info <AppstoreIcon style="fill: var(--vp-c-text-1); display: inline-block; height:16px; vertical-align: middle; margin:  0 -4px 0 -3px;" />&nbsp;PopClip has left the Mac App Store

As of 20th March 2024, PopClip is no longer distributed on the Mac App Store. I explained the reasons in a [forum post](https://forum.popclip.app/t/popclip-is-leaving-the-mac-app-store/2188).

Existing Mac App Store customers may [migrate for free to the Standalone edition](https://www.popclip.app/kb/mas) to continue receiving updates.

## Setapp

Alternatively, PopClip is also available as part of a
[Setapp subscription](https://go.setapp.com/stp304?refAppId=159&refVendorId=92).
This is a great option if you are interested in using the other apps available
from Setapp as well.
