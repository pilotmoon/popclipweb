# Welcome

Welcome to the official website for PopClip.

## What is PopClip?

PopClip is a Mac utility tool that pops up with a menu of actions when you
select text on your screen.

![PopClip screenshot](/media/popclip.jpg "Screenshot of PopClip")

PopClip's actions range from simple copy-paste and web searches to complex tasks
such as translating text. Using [extensions](/extensions/), you can add more
actions to PopClip to adapt it to your needs. Think of PopClip as a
context-aware assistant that provides a set of tools you can use instantly in
any app.

PopClip is available for macOS only. It is a [paid](/buy) app with a
[free trial](/download). It has been in continuous development since 2011.

Want to get started? Check out the [Installation](install) page.

## :thinking: Frequently asked questions

_See also [Troubleshooting](/kb/troubleshooting) if you have questions about
technical issues._

- **Is there a version of PopClip for iPhone or iPad?** Unfortunately PopClip
  would not be possible on these devices due to the way iOS works.

- **Is there a version of PopClip for Windows?** I don't make a Windows version
  of PopClip and I have no plans to do so. There is a similar app for Windows
  called [SnipDo](https://snipdo-app.com/) (formerly Pantherbar) that was
  inspired by PopClip. However, I have no involvement with that app at all.

## :earth_africa: Languages and translation

PopClip's user interface is developed in English and is translated into Chinese
(Traditional and Simplified), French, Danish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese,
Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Ukrainian,
Vietnamese and Turkish. These translations have been produced by a mix of paid
translation services and volunteer users.

Users can contribute translations in their own language using the CrowdIn
platform. If you would like to add or suggest changes to translations, please go
to the
[Pilotmoon Apps project on CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/pilotmoon-apps).
If your language does not exist in the project, send me an email so I can add
it.

The documentation is only available in English.

## :man_juggling: About the developer

PopClip is not made by a large company or even a small team; one person makes it
— me, Nick Moore. I'm from the UK and my native language is English. To get in
touch, see [Support and Feedback](/support).

[Pilotmoon Software](https://pilotmoon.com/about/) is the business name under
which I have published my apps. You will see some links and references to
`pilotmoon.com` in various places, and I use the `@pilotmoon` handle on GitHub
and elsewhere.

::: info :turtle:&ensp;It's turtles all the way down

For space, I've limited the list to include only a selection of the libraries
I've directly imported. And of course, most of the above projects also include
other projects. So the full list would be much longer.
