# Welcome

Welcome to the official website for PopClip.

## What is PopClip?

PopClip is a Mac utility tool that pops up with a menu of actions when you
select text on your screen.

![PopClip screenshot](/media/popclip.jpg "Screenshot of PopClip")

PopClip's [actions](/guide/actions) range from simple copy-paste and web
searches to complex tasks such as translating text. Using
[extensions](/extensions/), you can add more actions to PopClip to adapt it to
your needs. Think of PopClip as a context-aware assistant that provides a set of
tools you can use instantly in any app.

PopClip is available for macOS only. It is a [paid](/buy) app with a
[free trial](/download). It has been in continuous development since 2011.

## :open_book: **Site contents**

This website aims to be a complete resource for PopClip users. It contains all
the documentation for PopClip in one place, with the following sections:

- The **User Guide** is an introduction to PopClip. [Install](/guide/install)
  PopClip and learn the [basic concepts](/guide/basics) of the user interface.
  Take a tour of the [built-in actions](/guide/actions), see how to customize
  the [settings](/guide/settings) and add [extensions](/guide/extensions).

- Vital **App Info**, including [download links](/download),
  [purchase information](/buy), [version history](/changelog), and
  [support](/support) details.

- The **Knowledge Base** section, with a detailed
  [troubleshooting guide](/kb/troubleshooting) and technical articles.

- **Policies** including [license terms](/terms) and [privacy](/privacy) policy.

- A **Developer Reference** section with [detailed documentation](/dev/) on how
  to create PopClip extensions.

Finally, there is the [Extensions Directory](/extensions/), a dedicated section
of the site for browsing ready-made extensions to add to PopClip.

## :thinking: Frequently asked questions

_See also [Troubleshooting](/kb/troubleshooting) if you have questions about
technical issues._

- **Is there a version of PopClip for iPhone or iPad?**
  Unfortunately PopClip would not be possible on on these devices due to the way iOS works.

- **Is there a version of PopClip for Windows?** I don't make a
  Windows version of PopClip and I have no plans to do so. There is a similar
  app for Windows called [SnipDo](https://snipdo-app.com/) (formerly Pantherbar)
  that was inspired by PopClip. However, I have no involvement with that app at
  all.

- **Can you make the Dictionary action use the macOS pop-up dictionary instead
  of the Dictionary app?** I'd love to do this, but it is technically not
  possible (as far as I know).

## :earth_africa: Languages and translation

PopClip's user interface is developed in English and is translated into Chinese
(Traditional and Simplified), French, Danish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese and Turkish. These
translations have been produced by a mix of paid translation services and
volunteer users.

Users can contribute translations in their own language using the CrowdIn
platform. If you would like to add or suggest changes to translations, please go
to the
[Pilotmoon Apps project on CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/pilotmoon-apps).
If your language does not exist in the project, send me an email so I can add
it.

The documentation is only available in English.

## :man_juggling: About the developer

PopClip is not made by a large company or even a small team; one person makes it
— me, Nick Moore. I'm from the UK and my native language is English. To get in
touch, see [Support and Feedback](/support).

[Pilotmoon Software](https://pilotmoon.com/about/) is the business name under
which I have published my apps. You will see some links and references to
`pilotmoon.com` in various places, and I use the `@pilotmoon` handle on GitHub
and elsewhere.

::: info :turtle:&ensp;It's turtles all the way down

For space, I've limited the list to include only a selection of the libraries
I've directly imported. And of course, most of the above projects also include
other projects. So the full list would be much longer.
