# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

I am [Nicholas Moore](https://pilotmoon.com/about), a sole trader in the United
Kingdom doing business using the trading name Pilotmoon Software. I run an
independent software business and make my income by selling Mac apps. No part of
my business involves gathering your personal data, tracking you, or targeting
ads at you. I only collect information as necessary to provide my services to
you, as described below.

## Buying from the Mac App Store

When you buy my product from the Mac App Store, your order will be processed by
Apple. Apple does not pass any of your personal information on to me. I am
therefore unable to assist with individual Mac App Store orders; order inquiries
should be directed to [Apple Support](https://getsupport.apple.com/).

## Buying a license key

When you buy a license key for my product, your order will be processed by a
reseller. I use [Paddle](https://paddle.com/) as my reseller worldwide, and
[Digitalychee](https://lizhi.io/) in China. The reseller will pass me your name
and email address, which will be encoded as part of your license key. I retain
this information so I can help you if you contact me about an order.

## Using my apps

Some features of my apps require an internet connection. I do not want to be
responsible for storing sensitive data, and so my apps are designed to avoid
sending data to my own servers wherever possible. None of my apps send any data
away from your device, except as described below or where otherwise explicitly
indicated within the app.

### Extensions

Some of my apps offer the ability to install extensions that interact with
third-party services on the internet. (For example, "send to Instapaper" or
"translate with Google Translate".) All such communication occurs directly
between your device and the third-party using secure HTTPS APIs; my servers do
not act as an intermediary. Your use of these extensions is subject to the
policies of the relevant third-party services.

Where extensions require login details such as a username and password, these
are stored locally on your device, in the operating system's secure keychain.
Your login details are never sent to my servers.

### Update checking

My apps include update checking functionality. When auto-update is turned on,
the app will periodically contact my web server to see if an update is
available. Update checking may send me anonymous system information such as app
version and operating system version. You can disable update checking within the
app's preferences.

### Crash reporting

My apps have crash reporting functionality. If a crash occurs, the app will send
the technical details of the crash to me, to help me fix it. My crash reporting
functionality is provided by [Microsoft App Center](https://appcenter.ms/).

### Analytics

My apps have analytics functionality. The app will report anonymous usage data
to me, including the type of computer, the version of macOS, the number of times
the app is used, the number of times each feature within the app is used, and
the identifiers of other applications you interact with using the app. This
helps me improve the app and improve compatibility with other apps. No personal
information or user data is recorded. My analytics functionality is provided by
[Microsoft App Center](https://appcenter.ms/).

### Log files

My apps keep local log files for debugging and diagnostic purposes. These logs
may record the actions you take within the app. All log files stay on your
device.

## Visiting my websites

My websites are:

- <https://pilotmoon.com>
- <https://www.popclip.app>

When you access my websites, your visit will be recorded in my server logs. The
logs record the page URL, date and time, referrer URL (if any), IP address,
device type, operating system and browser.

My websites use no advertising or tracking cookies. Cookies and local storage
are used for functionality such as purchase flow, user preferences and login
sessions.

### Forum

The PopClip forum (<https://forum.popclip.app>) is self-hosted using
[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) forum software. The forum contains its
own [privacy notice](https://forum.popclip.app/privacy).

## Mailing list

I have a mailing list for sending out marketing emails. You will not be added to
my mailing list unless you explicitly request to be added. You can unsubscribe
yourself from the mailing list at any time. My mailing list provider is
[MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/).

## Other third-party services

I also use the following third-party vendors to provide my services to you:

- My web hosts are [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/),
  [DigitalOcean](htts://digitalocean.com) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- My email host is [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/).
- I use [Groove](https://groovehq.com/) to manage my email help desk.
- I use [GitHub](https://www.github.com/pilotmoon/) to host public code
  repositories and track issues.
- I use [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) to accept payments and donations.
- I use [X](https://twitter.com/) to communicate with you.

## Changes to this policy

This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. I will always publish the
latest version here on my website.
