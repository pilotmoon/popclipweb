# Terms of License

## Definitions

_I_, _me_: [Nicholas Moore](https://pilotmoon.com/about), a sole trader in the
United Kingdom doing business using the trading name Pilotmoon Software.

_Product_: the PopClip software application. The scope of the product does not
include any extensions (see [Extensions](#extensions) below).

_You_: a free trial user or a licensed user of the product.

_Authorized Reseller_: a business authorized by me to to sell license keys for
the product to end customers (see
[Appendix A](#appendix-a-authorized-resellers-and-subscription-services)).

_App Store_: Apple's Mac App Store.

## Free trial

Where the product has a free trial mode, I grant you the right to use the
product free of charge for the period of the trial. The trial mode may include
purchase reminders and limitations on usage.

I encourage you to make use of the free trial before buying to see if the
product is suitable for your needs.

## License key purchases

License keys may only be purchased through an authorized reseller.

### License grant

In consideration of the purchase fee paid by you to the reseller, I grant you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable,
royalty-free right and license to use the product, subject to these terms and
the reseller's terms.

### License keys

During the purchase process, you will receive a license key and instructions on
how to use it to activate the product. Activating the product removes all trial
restrictions and purchase reminders.

The license key will be registered to a named user and email address at the time
of purchase.

::: info Change of registered details

To change the registered name and/or email address after purchase,
[contact support](/support).

:::

License keys have the following restrictions:

- Personal license: A personal license key may be used to activate the product
  any number of computers that the registered user owns or controls (including
  work computers), for use only by the registered user.

- Multi-user license: A multi-user license is for a specified number of users in
  a named organization, team, or business. It may be used to activate the
  product on any number of computers, for use by no more than the specified
  number of users simultaneously.

If you share, publish, or otherwise allow the use of your license key beyond
that granted by the license, your license will be revoked, and you may no longer
use the product. In such a case, I may use technical means to disable the use of
the license key.

## Update policy

In the first instance, your license entitles you to use the version of the
product that existed at the time of purchase. Following your purchase, I may, at
my sole discretion, provide updated versions of the product in the future.

Your entitlement to future updates depends on the type of license you have:

- Time-limited license: entitles you to all product updates I release within the
  stated time period from the date of purchase. Upon expiry, you may continue to
  use the last version of the product released during the license period, but
  you will need to purchase a new license to receive further updates.

- Lifetime license: entitles you to all product updates I release for as long as
  the product exists.

You may be required to make further payments within the license period to use
features that have a recurring cost component such as syncing, API access, or
other online features.

### Previous update policy

Prior to 20th May 2024, the update policy was as follows:

> Your App Store or license key purchase entitles you to lifetime use of the
> version of the product that was available at the time of purchase. I may, at
> my sole discretion, provide updated versions of products in future, either as
> free updates (downloadable from the App Store and/or activatable using your
> existing license key), or as paid updates requiring a further purchase or
> subscription.

For past purchases I will apply the following policy:

- Purchased on or after 1st January 2023: Will be treated as a lifetime license.

- Purchased before 1st January 2023: Updates will continue to be at my
  discretion. I may release an update in future which is a paid update for you.

## Transfer policy

App Store and license key purchases are separate license agreements and are not
transferable between each other. Purchasing on the App Store does not entitle
you to receive a license key for the same product. If you wish, you may buy a
license key separately, in addition to your App Store purchase.

::: tip Discount for App Store customers

I am currently offering a 50% discount on license key purchase to existing App
Store customers of the same product. Please email proof of your App Store
purchase to
<a href="mailto:support@pilotmoon.com">support@pilotmoon.com</a> and I will send
you a coupon code.

:::

## Refund policy

### Refunds of license key purchases

For license key purchases, you may request a refund from from me for 30 days
from the date of purchase. You do not need to provide a reason. To request a
refund, email me at <support@pilotmoon.com>, stating your purchase order number
and the email address you used for the purchase. I will ask the reseller to send
back the money in full. After you receive the refund, your license will be
revoked and you may no longer use the product.

You may also have the right to request a refund directly from the reseller,
according to the reseller's terms and conditions.

::: info Please try before you buy

I make a loss on all refunds due to transaction fees. Therefore, I ask that you
make use of the free trial before buying, and only ask for a refund in
exceptional circumstances.

:::

### Refunds of App Store purchases

App Store purchases are subject to Apple's refund policies. If you want a refund
for your purchase from the App Store, please contact
[Apple support](https://getsupport.apple.com/).

## Setapp subscriptions

If you are a subscriber to Setapp, you may use the product as part of your
subscription.

### Setapp license grant

In consideration of the subscription fees paid by you to Setapp, I grant you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable
(subject to your continued payment of the subscription fees when due and
payable), royalty-free right and licence to use the product subject to these
terms and Setapp’s Terms and Conditions.

## App Store purchases

App Store purchases are subject to Apple's
[standard End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/).

::: info App store purchases and multiple Macs

The App Store EULA lets you install and use the product on any Mac that you own
or control. You can install PopClip on a new Mac by signing in to the store with
the same Apple ID you used to purchase the product.

:::

## Extensions

I and others may publish downloadable add-on extensions that add functionality
to the product. These extensions are not part of the licensed product and your
use of these extensions is not included in these license terms. Extensions are
subject to their own license terms as indicated.
